This folder (IntermediateCode) contains some of the intermediate code used to complete the 
Udacity Data Science nanodegree Introduction to Machine Learning final project.

One of the programs (data_exploration.py) was used to gather the information 
necessary to answer question one of the final report.

The other 4 Python files are programs used to implement 4 different
machine learning algorithms and those programs are named to reflect which 
algorithm is being implemented.  The code as it is now will run to produce the 
results documented "model performance" section of the final report.  
Some code is commented out of the program to show some of the exploration 
involved in completion of the project.  Some of these intermediate programs 
were used to do such things as determine which of the features is being selected 
in SelectKBest and to run Grid Search to find helpful tuning parameters.
